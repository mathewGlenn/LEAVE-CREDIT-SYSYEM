# CSS Cleanup: Sidebar Component Refactoring

## Overview

This document describes the changes made to clean up the CSS files by removing redundant sidebar styling from all non-sidebar CSS files. This refactoring improves maintainability by centralizing all sidebar styles in a single file.

## Changes Made

1. **Extracted and Consolidated Sidebar Styles**

   - All sidebar-related styles were moved to `sidebar.css`
   - Redundant sidebar styles were removed from individual page CSS files

2. **Files Updated**

   - `Employee.css`
   - `HR.css`
   - `Leave_history.css`
   - `Leave_status.css`
   - `Leave.css`
   - `Manage.css`
   - `Reports.css`
   - `Req_leave.css`

3. **Styles Removed from Each File**
   - `.sidebar`: Container styling for the sidebar
   - `.logo`: Styling for the LCMS logo
   - `.campus-name`: Styling for the campus name text
   - `.menu-item`: Styling for menu links
   - `.menu-item:hover`: Hover effects for menu items
   - `.menu-item.active`: Active state styling for the current page's menu item

## Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminates redundant code across multiple files
- **Simplified Maintenance**: Changes to sidebar styling only need to be made in one place
- **Smaller File Sizes**: Individual CSS files are now smaller and more focused
- **Better Separation of Concerns**: Each CSS file now only contains styles relevant to its specific page/component

## How to Use

1. Make sure to include both the page-specific CSS and the sidebar CSS in HTML files:

   ```html
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/sidebar.css" />
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="../CSS/[page-specific-css].css" />
   ```

2. When making changes to sidebar styling, only edit the `sidebar.css` file.

## Notes for Future Development

- Consider further refactoring to create a common CSS file for shared styles across all pages
- If additional sidebar features are needed, add them to `sidebar.css` only
- When creating new pages, do not add sidebar styles to their CSS files; use the shared `sidebar.css` instead
