# The process of requesting leave

1. **Submit a leave request**: Employees must submit a leave request through the designated system or form, providing all necessary details.
2. **Supervisor approval**: The request will be reviewed by the employee's supervisor, who will either approve or deny the request based on team needs and leave policies. The supervisor can also request a leave.
3. **HR review**: If approved, the request may be forwarded to HR for final review and to ensure compliance with company policies.

Note: Basically the employee leave request will be approved first by the supervisor and then finally by HR in order to be actually marked approved. The supervisor can also request a leave which is basically already approved by supervisor because he is a supervisor himself and only needs approval from HR for the leave to be officially granted. And for an HR leave request, the process is similar, but it is automatically approved by supervisor and HR already since he has the superadmin privilege.
